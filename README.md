## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Masinda_Gian-graded3_pandas_student.ipynb`) that performs various data analysis tasks on Zomato restaurant data. The notebook uses three datasets:

- **zomato.csv:** Contains restaurant information like average_cost_for_two and cuisines.
- **location.csv:** Contains location details of the restaurants like address, city, and locality.
- **ratings.csv:** Contains aggregate ratings for each restaurant.

The datasets are merged using the `id` column, which is a unique identifier for each restaurant.
